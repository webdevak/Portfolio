                <h4>Web-App-Dashboard</h4>
                <p class="resume-p">In this project, I built an interactive dashboard for a web app using advanced techniques 
                    including SVG graphics and JavaScript programming. This project involves tables, charts,
                     graphics and other user interface components in a manner that promotes interactivity and usability.</p>

                <h4>Used an API to Create an Employee Directory</h4>
                <p class="resume-p"> Used a random user generator API, to grab information for 12 random “employees”, and I used that data to 
                    build a prototype employee directory. Requested a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the 
                    data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image full name, email, and location. 
                    Clicking the employee’s image or name opens a modal window with more detailed information, such as employee’s birthday and address.
                     There is also a search bar to filter the directory by name.</p>

                <h4>Game Show App</h4>
                <p class="resume-p">I programmed a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players click letters from an 
                    onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase. Used JavaScript to create an array of phrases and write 
                    functions to choose a random phrase from that array, then split the phrase into letters, then 
                    I put those letters onto the game board. Each time the player guesses a letter, I compared the letter 
                    the player chose with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the board updates the chosen letters. 
                    A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter then chose isn’t in 
                    the phrase, one of the player’s 5 guesses is removed. If the player completes the phrase before they run out 
                    of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.
                     A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, the program disables that letter.</p>

                <h4>Random Quote Generator</h4>
                <p class="resume-p">A random quote generator, which displays quotations on a page, and can be controlled by the user. 
                    JavaScript variables, loops, conditionals and object literals we’re used to build the array of quotes. 
                    Then used objects to store the quotes. 
                    Created functions for selecting random quotes from the array and displayed them to the screen.</p>

                <h4>WEB Style guide </h4>
                <p class="resume-p">This project is more focused on converting CSS into SASS by splitting 
                    the code into several SASS partial files. 
                    To keep my code DRY, any length units, colors, etc., 
                    throughout the CSS were stored in SASS VARIABLES. </p>

                <h4>Interactive Photo Gallery</h4>
                <p class="resume-p">In this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout. 
                    At the top of the page there is a search bar that filters through the gallery showing and 
                    hiding the photos of the gallery depending on the user’s input. When users click on a thumbnail, 
                    the photo will display in a lightbox. 
                    There are next and previous arrows that cycle through the photos.</p>
